# Goal
Personal assistant (like Jarvis form Iron Man)

1. Make chat like interface (then add sound -> text, text -> sound, then also img...)
2. Make it able to detect from props parts of data in ("learning") and data out ("giving responses")
3. Handle data in
4. Handle data out
Later
- add more languages
- archive chats, see archived chats

# ToDo
- make navigation rail visible only when pressed button / screenwidt > ... , handle case when only 1 chat

# Questions
- When should a new conv start automatically? (after how much time)
